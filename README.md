# Project: Game Development with Bevy

This project marks the commencement of a comprehensive exploration into Rust programming through the development of a game using the Bevy game engine.

## Bevy: An Overview

Bevy is an efficacious, data-driven game engine implemented in Rust. It boasts an Entity Component System (ECS), alongside a plethora of other features specifically tailored for game development, including rendering and asset management. Engineered with a focus on speed, reliability, and simplicity, Bevy's architecture facilitates streamlined and intuitive game feature development.

## Project Objectives

The primary objective is to delve into Rust—a robust system programming language renowned for its performance and safety, especially with regards to safe concurrency. 

By employing Rust and Bevy in tandem, this project provides a practical environment to understand the various nuances of the language. It offers an avenue to gain insights into game development—an engaging, hands-on method to bolster programming skills.
